Welcome to my website! My name is Julius Soraely Munisi a Cyber Security Enthusiast.

I use this website as a sharing platform of my security write-ups and other tech stuff techniques.

I have always been interested in computer security and enjoy learning about new vulnerabilities and ways to protect against them.

On this website, you will find a variety of articles and resources on topics such as Windows and Linux Machines exploitation from different platforms such as Tryhackme and Hackthebox.

I hope that my content is informative and helpful to those who are interested in learning more about computer security.

Thank you for visiting my website. If you have any questions or suggestions, please don't hesitate to contact me via twitter or email.
