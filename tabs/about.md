Hey there! My name is peterChain and I prefer learning hacking stuff the hard way to diversify my Knowledge.
I am trying to document things as I learn and share it with community, Here you will find Write-ups for CTF challenges, some InfoSec articles and quick notes/Cheat sheets.

If you're interested in contacting me, LinkedIn and Twitter are good avenues or shoot me an email.
