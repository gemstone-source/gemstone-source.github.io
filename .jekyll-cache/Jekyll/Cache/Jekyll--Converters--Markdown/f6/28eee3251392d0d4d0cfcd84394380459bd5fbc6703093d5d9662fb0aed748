I"ÿ<p>As I was learning Cyber Threat Intelligence I chose Open CTI as demo tool while taking this path, and these were my installation steps which I followed while configuring it. In this document I will show steps used to install it by using <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">docker</code> image and manage them using <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">docker swarm</code>  and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">portainer</code>. I installed the Open CTI in two <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">ubuntu</code> machines where by one was used as <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">manager</code> and the second one as <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">worker</code>.</p>
