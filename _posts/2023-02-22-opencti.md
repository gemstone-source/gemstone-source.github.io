As I was learning Cyber Threat Intelligence I chose Open CTI as demo tool while taking this path, and these were my installation steps which I followed while configuring it. In this document I will show steps used to install it by using `docker` image and manage them using `docker swarm`  and `portainer`. I installed the Open CTI in two `ubuntu` machines where by one was used as `manager` and the second one as `worker`.

This document shows all necessary steps  used to install it by using `docker` image and mange them by using `docker swarm`  and `portainer` . 

All steps will be shown in `ubuntu` machines where by one has been used as `manager` and the second one as `worker`.

This setup has been implemented in vmware machine, so the first prerequisites should be installed in both `manager` and `worker` 

Below are the steps used to perform the task:

Install  a single `ubuntu` machine in vmware  followed by all the shared requirements as follows:-

**Update repository**
```
gemstone@hashghost:~$ sudo apt-get update -y
```
**Install Certificate preparation for docker**
```
gemstone@hashghost:~$ sudo apt-get install -y \
   apt-transport-https \
   ca-certificates \
   curl \
   gnupg-agent \
  software-properties-common
```
**Adding docker GPG key**
```
gemstone@hashghost:~$ curl -fsSL https://download.docker.com/linux/ubuntu/gpg | sudo apt-key add -
```
 **Check the fingerprint of the key**
```
gemstone@hashghost:~$ sudo apt-key fingerprint 0EBFCD88
```
**Adding docker repository in ubuntu machine**
```
gemstone@hashghost:~$ sudo add-apt-repository \
   "deb [arch=amd64] https://download.docker.com/linux/ubuntu \
   $(lsb_release -cs) \
   stable"
```
**Update repositories**
```
gemstone@hashghost:~$ sudo apt-get update -y
```
**Install docker and docker composer**
```
sudo apt-get install docker-ce docker-ce-cli containerd.io docker-compose
```
**Verify if docker has been successfully installed**
```
gemstone@hashghost:~$ sudo docker version
```
**Modify machine user and add the user to docker group**
```
gemstone@hashghost:~$ sudo usermod -aG docker $USER
```
**Shutting down the machine.**
```
gemstone@hashghost:~$ shutdown now
```
In this documentation OpenCTI is installed in virtual machine then all prerequisites needed for both `manager` and `worker` were already installed, then create a template to allow cloning of machines from `ubuntu` machine. 
Cloning will help to merge as many as possible machines with pre installed prerequisites.

This process is shown as follows:- 

![image](/assets/img/cti/01.png)

After enabled template mode clone two machines from `ubuntu` and the first machine name it as `OpenCTI-01` which will be used as `manager` and the second one  name it as `OpenCTI-02` which will be used as `worker` machine, all these information can be seen here below:-

![image](/assets/img/cti/02.png)
## Master
Starting with master machine, Start docker swarm and advertise the ip address of master user.
```
gemstone@opencti-01:~$ docker swarm init --advertise-addr 172.16.34.131
```
After the above command output will be the command to join the swarm with token and port number.
## Worker
This command is the output from master machine which allows worker's machine to join the swarm for management.
```
gemstone@opencti-02:~$ docker swarm join --token SWMTKN-1-1k179pcofdol52ia0yby85x5sm07wp93ioz95vp4j156uuv9i8-dfynlzfru7v3mlo6q7pavdvf6 172.16.34.131:2377
```
## Install Portainer
Portainer is used to manage docker image by providing graphical interface which fetch log data from machines with portainer.
```
mkdir -p /opt/portainer && cd /opt/portainer
curl -L https://downloads.portainer.io/portainer-agent-stack.yml -o portainer-agent-stack.yml
```
The above commands will create new directory  `/opt/portainer` navigate to it and then downloading `portainer-agent-stack.yml`  and save it with the same name. This file will have the following outputs:-
**Command**
```
gemstone@opencti-01:/opt/portainer$ cat portainer-agent-stack.yml
```
**Result**
``` 
version: '3.2'

services:
  agent:
    image: portainer/agent:2.11.1
    volumes:
      - /var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock
      - /var/lib/docker/volumes:/var/lib/docker/volumes
    networks:
      - agent_network
    deploy:
      mode: global
      placement:
        constraints: [node.platform.os == linux]

  portainer:
    image: portainer/portainer-ce:2.11.1
    command: -H tcp://tasks.agent:9001 --tlsskipverify
    ports:
      - "9443:9443"
      - "19000:9000"
      - "18000:8000"
    volumes:
      - portainer_data:/data
    networks:
      - agent_network
    deploy:
      mode: replicated
      replicas: 1
      placement:
        constraints: [node.role == manager]

networks:
  agent_network:
    driver: overlay
    attachable: true

volumes:
  portainer_data:
```
There is port numbers which portainer will use them during access, these ports are common and should changed to avoid any collision. 
```
      - "9000:9000"
      - "8000:8000"
```
Add this one as shown below:-
```
      - "19000:9000"
      - "18000:8000"
```
After all the installation you be able to access portainer in web browser by using manager `ip` which is `http://172.16.34.131` with port number `19000` . At a time I document this I was already created an account so it claimed for password because I am known user to it.

Portainer will start to count all the images which are up and up to this stage its about 5 containers but there is no `opencti`  Then add new stack and named it as `opencti` .

![image](/assets/img/cti/04.png)

Since we were using portainer then it is clearly that we have to install the docker version of opencti. Visited  official` github` page of opencti and grab the `.yml` file and add it to the portainer also and add some connectors which opencti will use to collect data from as shown below:

![image](/assets/img/cti/20.png)

Adding configuration file with connectors API keys.

![image](/assets/img/cti/07.png)

Also add the environment variables which contains  some credentials for the opencti login also the sample of these variables  from opencti GitHub page as shown below:- 

![image](/assets/img/cti/12.png)

After adding the environment it will be seen as follows:-

![image](/assets/img/cti/13.png)

After adding the configuration file and environment variables then deploy machine and stack number was improved to two which are opencti stack and portainer, also number of containers increased.

## Deploying OpenCTI

After adding the stack and some connectors in portainer then click deploy stack and wait for some times then access opencti with manager `ip` again but this time with another port number which is `8080`

**Dashboard**

**Analyze**

In this part different reports are displayed from the connectors we added before. Example of report is the Raspberry Robin's botnet second life.

**Reading the report**

You can click this report to see its description and date it was published.

**Connectors**

You can clicked on database at bottom left of side bar and then connector. One of the connector added is `AlienVault` and it is shown below.

Thanks for reading.

The End.
