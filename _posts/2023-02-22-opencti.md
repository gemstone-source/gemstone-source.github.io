As i was learnig Cyber Threat Intelligence i chose Open CTI as demo tool while taking this path, and these were my installation steps i followed while configuring it. In this document i will show steps i used to install it by using `docker` image and mange them by using `docker swarm`  and `portainer`. I instelled the Open CTI in two `ubuntu` machines where by one has been used as `manager` and the second one as `worker`.

This setup has been implemented in vmware machine, so the first few prerequisites should be installed in both `manager` and `worker`. At first i created single `ubuntu` machine and install all the shared requirements as follows:

**Update repository**
```
gemstone@hashghost:~$ sudo apt-get update -y
```
**Install Certificate preparation for docker**
```
gemstone@hashghost:~$ sudo apt-get install -y \
>     apt-transport-https \
>     ca-certificates \
>     curl \
>     gnupg-agent \
>     software-properties-common
```
**Adding docker GPG key**
```
gemstone@hashghost:~$ curl -fsSL https://download.docker.com/linux/ubuntu/gpg | sudo apt-key add -
```
 **Check the fingerprint of the key**
```
gemstone@hashghost:~$ sudo apt-key fingerprint 0EBFCD88
```
**Adding docker repository in ubuntu machine**
```
gemstone@hashghost:~$ sudo add-apt-repository \
>    "deb [arch=amd64] https://download.docker.com/linux/ubuntu \
>    $(lsb_release -cs) \
>    stable"
```
**Update repositories**
```
gemstone@hashghost:~$ sudo apt-get update -y
```
**Install docker and docker composer**
```
sudo apt-get install docker-ce docker-ce-cli containerd.io docker-compose
```
**Verify if docker has been successfully installed**
```
gemstone@hashghost:~$ sudo docker version
```
**Modify machine user and add the user to docker group**
```
gemstone@hashghost:~$ sudo usermod -aG docker $USER
```
**Shutting down the machine.**
```
gemstone@hashghost:~$ shutdown now
```
Since i was installing opencti in virtual machine then all prerequisites needed for both `manager` and `worker` were already installed, then i created template to allow cloning of machines from `ubuntu` machine as follows:

![image](/assets/img/cti/01.png)

After enabled template mode i cloned two machines from `ubuntu` and the first machine i named it as `OpenCTI-01` which will be used as `manager` and the second one as `OpenCTI-02` which will be used as `worker` machine, all these information has been displayed below:

![image](/assets/img/cti/02.png)
## Master
I started with master machine and i started docker swarm and advertised the ip address of master user.
```
gemstone@opencti-01:~$ docker swarm init --advertise-addr 172.16.34.131
```
After the above command output will be the command to join the swarm with token and port number.
## Worker
This command is the output from master machine which allows worker's machine to join the swarm for management.
```
gemstone@opencti-02:~$ docker swarm join --token SWMTKN-1-1k179pcofdol52ia0yby85x5sm07wp93ioz95vp4j156uuv9i8-******************** 172.16.34.131:2377
```
## Install Portainer
Portainer is used to manage docker image by providing graphical interface which fetch log data from machines with portainer.
```
mkdir -p /opt/portainer && cd /opt/portainer
curl -L https://downloads.portainer.io/portainer-agent-stack.yml -o portainer-agent-stack.yml
```
The above commands will create new directory  `/opt/portainer` navigate to it and then downloading `portainer-agent-stack.yml`  and save it with the same name. This file will have the following outputs:-
**Command**
```
gemstone@opencti-01:/opt/portainer$ cat portainer-agent-stack.yml
```
**Result**
``` 
version: '3.2'

services:
  agent:
    image: portainer/agent:2.11.1
    volumes:
      - /var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock
      - /var/lib/docker/volumes:/var/lib/docker/volumes
    networks:
      - agent_network
    deploy:
      mode: global
      placement:
        constraints: [node.platform.os == linux]

  portainer:
    image: portainer/portainer-ce:2.11.1
    command: -H tcp://tasks.agent:9001 --tlsskipverify
    ports:
      - "9443:9443"
      - "19000:9000"
      - "18000:8000"
    volumes:
      - portainer_data:/data
    networks:
      - agent_network
    deploy:
      mode: replicated
      replicas: 1
      placement:
        constraints: [node.role == manager]

networks:
  agent_network:
    driver: overlay
    attachable: true

volumes:
  portainer_data:
```
There is port numbers which portainer will use them during access, these ports are common and should changed to avoid any collision. 
```
      - "9000:9000"
      - "8000:8000"
```
I added one as shown below:-
```
      - "19000:9000"
      - "18000:8000"
```
After all the installation i was able to access portainer in web browser by using manager ip which is `http://172.16.34.131` with port number `19000` . At a time i document this i was already create an account so it claimed for password because i am known user to it.

Portainer will start to count all the images which are up and up to this stage its about 5 containers but there is no `opencti`  Then i added new stack and named it as `opencti` .

![image](/assets/img/cti/04.png)

Since i was using portainer then it is clearly that i have to install the docker version of opencti. i visited to the official github page of opencti and grab the `.yml` file and add it to the portainer also i added some connectors which will opencti will use to collect data from as shown below:-

![image](/assets/img/cti/20.png)

Adding configuration file with connectors API keys.

![image](/assets/img/cti/07.png)

Also i added the environment variables which contains  some credentials for the opencti login also the sample of these variables  from opencti GitHub page as shown below:- 

![image](/assets/img/cti/12.png)

After adding the environment it will be seen as follows:-

![image](/assets/img/cti/13.png)

After adding the configuration file and environment variables then i deployed machine and stack number was improved to two which are opencti stack and portainer, also number of containers increased.

## Deploying OpenCTI

After adding the stack and some connectors in portainer then i clicked deploy stack and waited for some times then access opencti with manager ip again but this time with another port number which is `8080`

**Dashboard**

**Analyze**
In this part different reports are displayed from the connectors i added before. Example of report is the Raspberry Robin's botnet second life.

**Reading the report**
I clicked this report to see its description and date it was published.

**Connectors**
I clicked on database at bottom left of side bar and then connector. One of the connector i added is `AlienVault` and it is shown below.
