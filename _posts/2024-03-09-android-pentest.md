Mobile application penetration test is similar to web application pentest but it can sometimes be trick to set an environment to perform this action. In this post I will share all necessary steps required to set an environment for android applications penetration test.

## Prerequisites

In order to have a replica of this setup you have to install the followings:

1. Linux Machine - For this setup I will use kali Linux but any Operating System can be used.
2. adb
3. Genymotion or android phone.
4. Virtualbox.
5. Frida.
6. Burpsuite.

## Tools Installation.

Am assuming you have Linux distribution of your choice and proceed with installation of other tools.

### Adb

This tool can simply be installed by only type the following:

```
└─$ sudo apt install adb
```

### Virtualbox

All required steps to install `virutalbox` on Kali Linux can be found this [link](https://www.kali.org/docs/virtualization/install-virtualbox-host/)

### Genymotion

This will help to provide a virtual phone which will be used during emulation of different android applications. To download it use this [link](https://www.genymotion.com/product-desktop/download/) and select your installation file according to your OS but in this post I will use [linux_binary](https://dl.genymotion.com/releases/genymotion-3.6.0/genymotion-3.6.0-linux_x64.bin).

```
└─$ mv genymotion-3.6.0-linux_x64.bin /opt && cd /opt
└─$ mkdir genymotion && mv genymotion-3.6.0-linux_x64.bin genymotion && cd genymotion
└─$ chmod +x genymotion
└─$ ./genymotion
```

If it is your first time to use `genymotion` you will have to register for new free account otherwise you can login.

### Frida

To install `frida` tool is very simple you can use this [link](https://frida.re/docs/installation/) or simply you can use this simple command

```
└─$ pip install frida-tools
```

Sometimes this fails but all you have to do is to use it with privileged user or you can use `sudo` because it can fail to create path under low privileges.

```
└─$ sudo pip install frida-tools
```

Up to now I have all required tools to start pentest, `burpsuite` is pre installed in Kali so no need to reinstall it unless you have a licence and upgrade it to pro version.

## Hands on no more stories.

### Installation and setup of virtual phone.

To perform this action we need a phone a real one or virtual phone, I will use virtual phone from `genymotion` through the following steps:

**Download latest phone of your choice.**

Follow pictures below to install your new android application.

![image](/assets/img/android/01.png)

Select phone of your choice on my side I will choose `samsung s23` but you can pick any.

![image](/assets/img/android/02.png)

You can modify some few things including mobile name and also specs of mobile phone but some requires a licence but you can leave all the defaults and it will work fine.

![image](/assets/img/android/03.png)

Now you will have phone which will open like this.

![image](/assets/img/android/05.png)

**Install `Playstore` on virtual phone and sign in with you google account.**

Click a button on your virtual phone named `Open GApps` and click accept to download it.

![image](/assets/img/android/06.png)

After installation of `GApp` pop window will appear click restart now to restart your virtual mobile phone.

![image](/assets/img/android/07.png)

After rebooting mobile phone now `playstore` will be available and can be accessible.

![image](/assets/img/android/08.png)

Now sign in with your google account to have access `playstore` so that you can download different applications.

![image](/assets/img/android/09.png)

Now I have full access and I can download any application of my choice from the store.

### Install Burp Certificate and Configure proxy.

**Start `Burpsuite` and then run the following commands:**

```
└─$ curl localhost:8080/cert -o cert.der
```

Above command will download certificate from `burpsuite` and save it as `cert.der`

**Convert installed file to `perm` format and rename it.**

```
└─$ openssl x509 -inform der -in cert.der -out burp.pem
└─$ openssl x509 -inform PEM -subject_hash_old -in burp.pem
```

This will result to the following:

```

-----END CERTIFICATE-----
```

But name of certificate should be `md5sum` of subject which can be seen as the fist line with these characters `9a5ba575`. Now to rename certificate use the following command

```
└─$ mv burp.pem 9a5ba575.0
```

**Install Certificate in mobile device.**

To install `burpsuite` certificate follow this trail Go to `Settings -> Security -> More security settings -> Encryption & credentials -> Trusted credentials`. After all these look for `Portswigger` you wont see it because it is not there and has not uploaded yet. To upload it use the following command:

```
└─$ adb push 9a5ba575.0 /system/etc/security/cacerts/
9a5ba575.0: 1 file pushed, 0 skipped. 3.0 MB/s (1330 bytes in 0.000s)
adb: error: failed to copy '9a5ba575.0' to '/system/etc/security/cacerts/9a5ba575.0': remote couldn't create file: Read-only file system
```

This will result to error because the file system is read only but since this emulated device is rooted then it can be modified  and mounted through the following commands:

```
└─$ adb shell
vbox86p:/ # mount -o remount,rw /
vbox86p:/ # exit
```

Now upload again it will work.

```
└─$ adb push 9a5ba575.0 /system/etc/security/cacerts/
9a5ba575.0: 1 file pushed, 0 skipped. 11.7 MB/s (1330 bytes in 0.000s)
```

No more error. Now check again if certificate has been uploaded to your virtual mobile phone.

**Setting proxy on mobile phone**

Since am using `wifi` network then I will configure my `wifi` IP as proxy.

![image](/assets/img/android/12.png)

To add this on mobile phone I will use the following command:

```
└─$ adb shell settings put global http_proxy $(ifconfig | grep wlan0 -A 5 | head -n 2| tail -n 1| awk '{print $2 }')
```

This command will take only the IP address from `wifi` interface and configure it as proxy in mobile phone. To unset this proxy setting you can use the following command:

```
└─$  adb shell settings put global http_proxy :0
```

One more thing is to configure `burpsuite` to allow requests from all interface rather than only `loopback` to this you can go to `burpsuite` and do the followings:

Go to Proxy Settings -> And follow below pictures

![image](/assets/img/android/13.png)

Select all interfaces and click ok button if pop window appear then click yes to accept changes.

![image](/assets/img/android/14.png)

After finish setting then it will now appears as follows:

![image](/assets/img/android/15.png)

**Test if proxy is configured well**

I will use `udom` university as an example. Below image will show before sending request to web application by using mobile phone.

![image](/assets/img/android/16.png)

Now I will show after sending request to google servers about The University of Dodoma.

![image](/assets/img/android/17.png)

Now I can see all traffics on `burpsuite` and intercept them for more researches.

This document has been long enough and I have decided to prepare another one as part two which will cover bypass ssl pinning and capture traffics from specific android application. The part two can be found [here](https://gemstone-source.github.io/android_pentest/)
